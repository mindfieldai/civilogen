## 🧠 What Is CIVILOGEN?

It is an **AI-powered feedback and foresight engine** that allows governments to:

- Listen to the **emotional field of their people**
- Translate real-world voices into **policy pressure maps**
- Simulate **long-term effects of political decisions**
- Receive feedback on **speech tone, trust, and trauma**
- Access **citizen dream-fields**: the subconscious civic voice
